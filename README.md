### üöÄ About me
A technology enthusiast, I took my first steps in Basic on the Tk 2000 II computer (a distant clone of the Apple II). I learned Clipper and Visual Basic as an enthusiast. After a career as a graphic designer and technician in the wind power generation sector, I returned to studying programming to become a full-stack developer.

Today thanks to DIO.me and FreeCodeCamp, I study Git, Github, Html 5, CSS, Javascript, Front End Libraries, Relational Databases, Back-end JavaScript and Python.

I hope to be re-entering the job market very soon, this time enjoying geographical and financial independence.
